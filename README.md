# Introduction

With the upcoming release of Alonzo, there will be a lot of innovative projects looking for a place to initially distribute their tokens. There will also be lots of DeFi users looking for a place to trade new tokens as well as support their favorite projects. This is the premise of MinSwap - a multi-pool automated market maker. What is multi-pool, anyway? It means that there can be multiple pricing functions for one single pair, for example constant-product function, StableSwap invariant, Kyber's DMM function, etc. The trading interface will compute and route to the most efficient pools.

## Features

_Fair Launch:_ No pre-mine, no pre-sale. MIN tokens are distributed fairly with only 10% allocated to development funds.  
_Yield Farming:_ MIN tokens are rewarded to liquidity providers who stake their liquidity pool tokens.  
_Launchpool:_ Supporting new projects in Cardano ecosystem with Initial DEX Offering \(IDO\) and Initial Farm Offering \(IFO\).  
_Permissionless:_ Anybody can list tokens without permission. Anybody can trade tokens without KYC.  
_Community First:_ All trading fees go directly to liquidity providers. MIN token holders can vote democratically on protocol changes.  
_Ethereum Compatible_: With ERC-20 Converter, users can trade Ethereum tokens at much lower fees.  
_Stake Pool Operators Support_: Minswap supports the SPOs by a community-oriented ADA delegation policy and automatic native token fees conversion. \(more details in FAQ\)
