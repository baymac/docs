# MINt token

## What is MINt token?

MINt is a token that **converts into MIN** if locked in a contract with ADA for 45 days.&#x20;

Essentially, a user who wants to convert their MINt tokens, will **first** have to provide liquidity in our DEX. This means they will have to provide an asset pair (e.g., ADA and MELD in the ADA/MELD pool), to one of a series of predetermined pools. Once they have done so, they receive LP tokens in exchange, which represent their share of the pool based on the assets they deposited. Then, the user will take those LP tokens **along with** the MINt tokens they want to convert, and stake them in a Yield Farm on our DEX. The LP tokens will be **locked**, meaning the user will not be able to redeem them for the underlying assets, for a period of 45 days.

Meanwhile, the MINt tokens will be burnt, and the same amount of MIN tokens are minted into a vesting smart contract, set up to have 45 days of lock up and 45 days of linear vesting. This means that, after 45 days, the LP tokens will be **unlocked**, but the converted MIN tokens will go through an extra 45 days of linear vesting until they can be fully redeemed. We will have a Web3 interface to harvest any released MIN, and the process to harvest will be the same as harvesting MIN tokens from the FISO rewards.

## This too complex, can you me give an example?

You can read more about the MINt token, including an example in the following [article](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/how-to-convert-your-mint-tokens-c7331c8eaa01).

## When and until when can I start converting MINt tokens?

You can start converting on April 16th 2022. You can convert until April 16th 2023.&#x20;

## What is the intention of the MINt token

The **intention** of the MINt token is to encourage people to participate in the protocol and interact with our application. It should be reiterated that MINt tokens are locked then converted only when entered into a contract through our designated conversion interface. It is possible to create a MINt/ADA, or MINt/Any-Other-Asset, pair to trade MINt. However, after 73 epochs or one year after our March 8th launch, the converter will no longer work.

## Where did MINt come from?&#x20;

Minswap did their own ISO, a **FISO**. That’s how most of the MINt tokens made it into people’s wallets, via FISO or Airdrops from Minswap. Once the public had them, they’ve been listed on other DEXs where they are bought and sold.

## So MINt is just another token?

It might help to stop thinking of MINt as a token. It has no utility other than to be converted to MIN. It’s like a new company standing outside a store handing out coupons that let you claim one free Widget. The coupon is worth a widget so you could sell it, but the coupon itself is not a widget. And the coupon has an expiration date. So it’s not a deflationary coupon, it’s just a coupon that expires. MINt is a “coupon” that you’ll be able to convert to MIN, but MINt has an expiration date after which it is worthless.

## So how do I convert MINt to MIN?

First, you have to wait until Minswap launches on the Main Net. After launch, you will put liquidity into any pool, let’s use cNETA:ADA as an example since AnetaBTC is a Minswap partner. Let’s say cNeta is trading for 0.10 ADA. You’ll put 1,000 cNeta and 100 ADA into a cNeta:ADA Liquidity Pool. When you do that, the DEX will send a Liquidity Pool (LP) token to your wallet. DON’T LOSE IT. You must have the LP token in order to withdraw cNeta:ADA liquidity (but you won’t necessarily get 1,000:100 back because of Impermanent Loss, but that’s another story). You could make such a withdrawal at any time.

At this point, if you already own MINt tokens that you bought or were airdropped or earned in the FISO then you can use the LP tokens to convert the MINt to MIN. **You stake your LP tokens and your MINt, and you’re yield farming**. The implication of staking your LP token is that the LP token is back with the DEX, not in your wallet. That means you can’t withdraw the cNeta/ADA without un-staking the LP/MINt. But you must leave the **LP/MINt staked** for the entire vesting period to unlock your MIN. This is the reason for MINt, to incentivize people to put Liquidity into Liquidity Pools and leave it there for **at least 45 days** because Liquidity must be there for the DEX to function.

After the vesting period, when it is time to unstake LP/MINt, instead of getting LP and MINt back, you get LP and MIN. Your MINt has been converted to MIN and you could then send your LP tokens back to get the cNeta & ADA you put in as liquidity.

## What’s this Multiplier I hear about?

The multiplier refers to a boost on your **Yield Farming rewards** in comparison to people who are staking LP tokens without converting MINt. The multiplier will depend on the pool (so, the underlying pair to the LP tokens, for instance if the teams wants to incentivise conversion of MINt in ADA/LQ pair, they will give a high multiplier there).

## So what can I do with my MINt now?

Right now you can just hold them and be ready to provide liquidity and stake your MINt for the vesting period. If all that staking and impermanent loss and yield farming risk sounds like too much for you, then you could sell your MINt. They are worth less than MIN because of the risk and time involved in converting them.
