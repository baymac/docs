# Yield Farming Example

Let's lay out an example to make it clear:

**1)** _On Day 1_, let's say you have decided to provide liquidity in a pair and have as a result obtained 1,000,000 LP Tokens **(LPTs)**. You then stake those **1,000,000 LPTs** in their corresponding farm.&#x20;

**2)** _On Day 2_, you decide you want to farm more MIN in this particular farm. So, you provide more liquidity and you get as a result **2,000,000 LPTs**. You then stake these **2,000,000 LPTs**, so you now have **3,000,000 LPTs** on your Yield Farming position. Upon staking these additional **2,000,000 LPTs**, automatically, the rewards accrued from _Day 1_ for staking **1,000,000 LPTs** get calculated and sent to your wallet. Starting from _Day 2_, rewards for **3,000,000 LPTs** will start accruing.

**3)** _On Day 3_, you decide you want to withdraw **500,000 LPTs**. Upon withdrawal of the **500,000 LPTs**, the rewards for staking **3,000,000 LPTs** on _Day 2_ get calculated and sent to your wallet. You now start earning rewards for **2,500,000 LPTs** staked.&#x20;

4\) _On Day 4_, you decide not to add or withdraw any LP tokens, so your LPTs amount doesnâ€™t change. But you decide to harvest your current rewards, so then rewards for staking **2,500,000 LPTs** during _Day 4_ will get sent to your wallet.

In essence, through our system, we aim to make Yield Farming as convenient and user friendly as possible. Yield Farming participants can deposit additional LP Tokens or withdraw a portion of them **without needing to unstake them and lose any rewards**. Any MIN you have accrued will be waiting for you to harvest in **one click!**
