# Yield Farming

## What is Yield Farming?

Yield Farming is an initiative used by protocols in _DeFi_ to incentivize liquidity and utilization by rewarding users in governance tokens (such as MIN). The idea is to acquire users by giving them **ownership of the protocol itself**, in accordance with the _ethos_ of decentralized protocols that are wholly owned by their users.

In Minswap, this translates to distributing **MIN token rewards** to users who Provide Liquidity on our DEX and stake their Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens or **LPTs**). Staking LPTs will earn you MIN rewards in proportion to how much the share the LPTs you are staking is compared to the total LPTs staked in the particular farm. Minswap will aim to have an effective system for farming yield, while also offering the best user experience.

## **Yield Farming Vesting Schedule**

The Yield Farming Emission Schedule until mid August will be the following:

**1st month (16th March 2022 to 15th April) :** 1.2% total supply = 60 million MIN ≈ 2,000,000 daily. \
**2nd month (15th April 2022 to 15th May) :** 1.1% total supply = 55 million MIN ≈ 1,833,333 daily \
**3rd month** **(15th** **May 2022 to 14th June) :** 1% total supply = 50 million MIN ≈ 1,666,666 daily. \
**4th month (14th** **June 2022 to 14th July) :** 0.9% total supply = 45 million MIN ≈ 1,500,000 daily. \
**5th month (14th** **July 2022 to 13th August)** **:** 0.8% total supply = 40 million MIN ≈ 1,333,333 daily.

In total, to bootstrap liquidity and to ensure early supporters of Minswap are maximally rewarded, **5% of total supply** has been allocated towards _Yield Farming_ in the first 5 months. We welcome any community input regarding pools that could be added and schedule adjustment in our [Forum](https://forum.minswap.org/).
