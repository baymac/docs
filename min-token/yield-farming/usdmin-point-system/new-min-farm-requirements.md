# New MIN Farm Requirements

Please read the following Post for the requirements to be met for every project that wants to have a MIN Farm: [We want to open a MIN Farm! \[Proposed Template for Requests to have a new MIN Farm\]](https://forum.minswap.org/t/we-want-to-open-a-min-farm-proposed-template-for-requests-to-have-a-new-min-farm/1008)

In essence, the token should be trading on the DEX without any incentives for 2 weeks minimum, reach a minimum of 700,000 ADA TVL, and pass a Governance vote.&#x20;

Projects with less TVL can opt for the "Mouse Farm" route as well, which is explained in the following [article](https://t.co/qcwsFxHIb6). This approach also requires significant TVL, and a Forum Proposal such as the following [example](https://forum.minswap.org/t/adding-yummi-and-min-yield-farming-for-the-yummi-ada-pool-using-a-mouse-farm/1616).
