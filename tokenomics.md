# Tokenomics

The Minswap protocol currently has two types of tokens:

**MIN token:** The governance token of the protocol with future utility. \
\
**MINt token:** A token that can be converted to MIN through usage of the protocol. Please read the following [document](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/how-to-convert-your-mint-tokens-c7331c8eaa01) for the detailed mechanics.\
\
MINt token conversion will be available one month after the launch of our Yield Farms, meaning on the 14th of April 2022.

The Minswap **Token Distribution** is the following:

## Yield Farming

The Yield Farming Emission Schedule until the end of July will be the following:

**1st month (14th March 2022 to 14th April) :** 1.2% total supply = 60 million MIN ≈ 2,000,000 daily. \
**2nd month (14th April 2022 to 14th May) :** 1.1% total supply = 55 million MIN ≈ 1,833,333 daily \
**3rd month** **(14th** **May 2022 to 14th June) :** 1% total supply = 50 million MIN ≈ 1,666,666 daily. \
**4th month (14th** **June 2022 to 14th July) :** 0.9% total supply = 45 million MIN ≈ 1,500,000 daily. \
**5th month (14th** **July 2022 to 14th August)** **:** 0.8% total supply = 40 million MIN ≈ 1,333,333 daily.

In total, to bootstrap liquidity and to ensure early supporters of Minswap are maximally rewarded, **5% of total supply** has been allocated towards Yield Farming in the first 5 months. In July, the schedule will be adjusted. We welcome any community input regarding pools that could be added and schedule adjustment in our [Forum](https://forum.minswap.org).

The initial pools eligible for Yield Farming rewards are:&#x20;

* _**Lion Farm**_**: MIN/ADA** — **50 points**. The MIN/ADA pool will have 50 points, meaning 50% of the 2 million daily MIN rewards, or _1 million MIN daily_, will be allocated towards those who provide liquidity in the MIN/ADA pair and stake their LP tokens. As a reminder, everyone who provided ADA in the LBE and keeps the purrADA, will be able to exchange the purrADA for ADA/MIN LP tokens shortly and before Yield Farming commences.
* _**Tiger Farms:**_ **PAVIA/ADA, LQ/ADA, MELD/ADA, WMT/ADA, DANA/ADA** — **7 points each**. Each of these pools will have 7 points, meaning 7% of the 2 million daily MIN rewards, or _140,000 MIN daily_, will be allocated towards those who provide liquidity in each of these pairs and stake their LP tokens.
* _**Cat Farm:**_ **CNETA/ADA** — **5.5 points**. This means 5.5% of the 2 million daily MIN rewards, or _110,000 MIN daily._
* _**Kitty Farms:**_ **AADA/ADA, CLAP/ADA, VYFI/ADA** — **3 points**. Each of these pools will have 3 points, meaning 3% of the 2 million daily MIN rewards, or _60,000 MIN daily._
* _**Dog Farm:**_ **HOSKY/ADA** — **0.5 points**. This means 0.5% of the 2 million daily MIN rewards, or _10,000 MIN daily._

These farms are only the initial farms and will be subject to change as soon as one week after our their launch on March 14th.&#x20;

## Token Vesting Schedules

Tokens from the **team** will be locked for the first 6 months after the launch of the protocol, meaning they will not be accessible to team members during that time. After that time period, Team tokens will vest linearly during the next 2.5 years.

Regarding the 10% of total supply of tokens from the **development fund**, please note 0.5% of them were allocated to our public sale at the price of 1 ADA equals 40 MIN. 4% of these tokens will be unlocked at launch and the remaining 5.5% will vest in the same schedule as team tokens (6 months cliff and 2.5 years linear).

The **DAO Treasury** has an allocation of 6% of total supply. To bootstrap liquidity on the DEX, 2% of this supply has been allocated to our Liquidity Bootstrapping. All LP tokens obtained from this event and the remaining MIN tokens from the DAO treasury will be locked away for 6 months until a DAO treasury manager contract is implemented.

Additionally, the current **circulating supply** before the launch of our DEX for MIN is **50 million MIN** tokens. 25 million are from the public sale and the other 25 million are from the FISO. The current circulating supply for MINt tokens is **100 million MINt** from the FISO.
