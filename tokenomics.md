# Tokenomics

The Minswap protocol currently has two types of tokens:

**MIN token:** The governance token of the protocol with [utility](usdmin-token/). \
\
**MINt token:** A token that can be converted to MIN through usage of the protocol. Please read the following [document](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/how-to-convert-your-mint-tokens-c7331c8eaa01) for the detailed mechanics.\
\
MINt token conversion will be available one month after the launch of our Yield Farms, meaning on the 14th of April 2022.

The Minswap **Token Distribution** is the following:

## Token Vesting Schedules

For information on **Yield Farming**, go to the subsection of [Yield Farming](yield-farming/).&#x20;

Tokens from the **team** will be locked for the first 6 months after the launch of the protocol (_March 8th 2022_), meaning they will not be accessible to team members during that time. After that time period, Team tokens will vest linearly during the next 2.5 years.

Regarding the 10% of total supply of tokens from the **development fund**, please note 0.5% of them were allocated to our public sale at the price of 1 ADA equals 40 MIN. 4% of these tokens will be unlocked at launch and the remaining 5.5% will vest in the same schedule as team tokens (6 months cliff and 2.5 years linear).

The **DAO Treasury** has an allocation of 6% of total supply. To bootstrap liquidity on the DEX, 2% of this supply was allocated to our Liquidity Bootstrapping.&#x20;
